1. Find the prepared component `Box` and give it some styling.
2. Call the `Box` multiple times inside `App`.
3. Pass a "boolean prop" called `highlight` to all Boxes.
4. Use the prop inside the component. When `highlight` is `true`, then give the component another `className` called `box--highlight` (you have to create the `box--highlight` class yourself).
5. Experiment with the Box component and change the value of its prop highlight.

Create the components as described in the Wireframe. Which props should they get? Decide for yourself!

(Hint: The card component will be created from a user object containing all the data about a single user.)
