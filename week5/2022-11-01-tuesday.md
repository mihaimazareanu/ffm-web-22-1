### React Basics

- React is a library for building user interfaces. React is <b>not</b> a framework â€“ it's not even exclusive to the web.
- It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments. For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications.
- React does not enforce strict rules around code conventions or file organization
- React can handle a single button, a few pieces of an interface, or an app's entire user interface
- React utilizes features of modern JavaScript for many of its patterns. Its biggest departure from JavaScript comes with the use of JSX syntax. JSX extends JavaScript's syntax so that HTML-like code can live alongside it.

To initialize your React App use the following command:

```js
npx create-react-app 'name'
```

To run the Web Application in your browser, use:

```js
npm start
```

A typical App.js file to start with looks like this:

```js
import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React!
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

Don't confuse React with what you have already learned in JavaScript - for example: to define a class, you use this:

```js
   <header className="App-header">
```

If you find all this confusing and don't know where to start [try this](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react).

### React Props

- React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
- To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:

```js
const myElement = <Car brand="Ford" />;
```

- The component receives the argument as a props object:

```js
function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a {props.brand}!</h2>;
}
```

<b>Props are read only!</b>

Props are also used to <b>pass data</b> from one component to another, as parameters. To find out more, try [this example code](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_props.asp)!

If you want to see <b>Props</b> at work, take a look at [Stefans CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/ffm-web-22-1-react-props-gezyyl?file=/src/App.js).

And [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) just a little bit more infos and examples on Components and Props.
